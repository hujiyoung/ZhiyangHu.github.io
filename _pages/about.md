Research Field
======
I am interested in artificial intelligence. My main research focuses on security issues in computer vision and NLP, with some understanding of adversarial examples, backdoor attacks, and model watermarking. Currently, I am studying relevant knowledge of large language models

In fact, I have been conducting this research for less than a year, and my level is not high. I am still inexperienced. If you are interested in my research field, please feel free to contact me via email to discuss further

As you can see, I didn't fill in all the information on my personal web page, so some of the information in the website was pulled from the original repository and didn't match mine. For more precise information, please contact my email.
