Research Field
======
I am interested in artificial intelligence. My main research focuses on security issues in CV and NLP, with some understanding of adversarial examples, backdoor attacks and defense, and model watermarking. Currently, I am studying relevant knowledge of large language models.

In fact, I've been conducting this research for less than a year and I'm still inexperienced. If your field of study is similar to mine and you would like to collaborate with me, feel free to contact me via email to discuss further.

As you can see, I didn't fill in all the information on my personal web page, some of the information in the website was pulled from the original repository and didn't match mine. For more precise information, please contact my email.
